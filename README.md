Springboard Capstone Project 1 Ideas

I wanted to work on a project that either inspires me or motivates me to explore more and build a model to predict future impact. Here’s a list of a few datasets I have shortlisted:

1.	Bitcoin: Market Analysis since inception:
a.	Bitcoin is the most discussed crypto-currency till date. I was interested in Bitcoins from past 7 to 8 months now. The price for 1    Bitcoin since then has been grown to 300% and it is being speculated that it may reach $100,000 USD from current price of $2500 USD approx.
b.	I’m planning to consider historical price data and predict future prices with the dataset from Kaggle.

c.	My main goal with this project would be to showcase the enormous potential Bitcoin has and put forth an alternate investment option which may help to reap exponential rewards in near future.

2.	Global Warming:
a.	Since childhood I am always fascinated about the history of earth and its evolution over so many centuries. I am also concerned about the fact of Global Warming and its colossal impact on our day to day life.
b.	The dataset I have chosen is from The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) which is an integrated database of climate summaries from land surface stations across the globe. This data set contains gridded mean temperature anomalies.

c.	This granular dataset permits extensive historical analysis of the earth’s climate to answer questions about climate change, including how different regions of the planet have been affected by changes in temperature over time.

3.	2016 Global Ecological Footprint:
a.	This is also one of the area where I’m interested to explore more and try to answer some of the questions related to global ecological footprint of 188 countries.
b.	This dataset would try to answer whether your country consume more resources than it produces in a year.

c.	Some of the key questions this project would try to answer would be: Is your country running an ecological deficit. Which countries have the greatest ecological deficits or reserves? Do they consume less or produce more than the average country? When will Earth Overshoot Day, the day on the calendar when humanity has used one year of natural resources, occur in 2017?

Appreciate your feedback, suggestions and recommendations. Thanks!
